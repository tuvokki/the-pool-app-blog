                    A fullfledged, Elo-based ratingsystem for the GX Public pool competition will be here!
    
                    The Elo rating system is a method for calculating the relative skill levels of players in two-player games such as chess.
                    It is named after its creator Arpad Elo, a Hungarian-born American physics professor.

                    Arpad Elo was a master-level chess player and an active participant in the United States Chess Federation (USCF) from its
                    founding in 1939. The USCF used a numerical ratings system, devised by Kenneth Harkness, to allow members to track their
                    individual progress in terms other than tournament wins and losses. The Harkness system was reasonably fair, but in some
                    circumstances gave rise to ratings which many observers considered inaccurate. On behalf of the USCF, Elo devised a new
                    system with a more statistical basis.
                    
                    Elo's system replaced earlier systems of competitive rewards with a system based on statistical estimation. Rating systems
                    for many sports award points in accordance with subjective evaluations of the 'greatness' of certain achievements. For
                    example, winning an important golf tournament might be worth an arbitrarily chosen five times as many points as winning a
                    lesser tournament.

                    A statistical endeavor, by contrast, uses a model that relates the game results to underlying variables representing the
                    ability of each player.

                    You can always enjoy a pool game if both parties are playing fair, honest, and straightforward. Always be honest about your shots, fouls (mainly unseen fouls), or any other disputable plays. To avoid disputes, you should call your shot before it takes place.

                    Be courteous to other pool players. Do not try to distract an opponent while they are trying to take a shot, remain quiet and respect your opponents turn.

                    If a table has a set of house pool rules, one should abide by them. So, do not make up rules after the pool game has begun. If any rules are questionable, bring them up before the game has begun.
                    
                    Avoid sitting on the pool tables and always be aware of your surrounding players; A player may get upset if he or she misses a shot because of ones unobservant clumsiness.

                    Do not place your drink on or near the pool table. If a drink spills it can ruin the pool table cloth. Chalk can also ruin the pool table cloth. If a glove is not used, one should try to keep his or her chalk usage to a minimum. One should neither bend nor contort the pool sticks into any unnatural shapes.

                    One should not hold the pool stick behind the head. Not only does one risk the chance of hitting a passerby, but also one takes the chance of bending the pool stick. Do not bounce or throw the pool balls onto the table. The pool balls can break and the pool table has the possibility of acquiring a permanent indention.
                    
                    If you are looking for Online Pool Games, you will find variety of games to choose from. You can play an online snooker game, online 8 ball game, or online 9 ball game. These pool games are free to play and offered by many billiard sites. We list only the quality pool games that do not install spyware onto your computer.

                    A Play! application follows the MVC architectural pattern as applied to the 
                    architecture of the Web.
                    
                    This pattern splits the application into separate layers: the Presentation 
                    layer and the Model layer. The Presentation layer is further split into a 
                    View and a Controller layer.

                    Here @T.V.K. we have a philosophy. All commerce is some digital brand of front-end convergence. This is obvious, and recognized by several industry leaders. However in the hybrid, or even multibrid, playing field which we call modern opportunities, a company has to create accelerated new-fangaled problems in order to stay on top op the competition.

                    Time to unleash frictionless systems upon a new brand of scale wireless infrastructures. Everybody talks about positioning value-added e-markets, but nobody knows how to interpret this for mobile devices like the iPone, iPad or iPod. Smartphones converge systematized long-memory choices of companies to 'get closer to the customer', like we said in the '90's. And now we lost touch with reality, because we cannot see our customer anymore. The buyers in this diverging markets are transforming our next-generation deliverables. Either we are too close to the market, or our market shifted to internet cafe's, cityparks or just the street, where a shivering 23% of online sales take place nowadays.

                    T.V.K. WebServices has the answer. We know how to synthesize global networks into engineering with proactive schemas. Any derivative nonstationary strict variable is a small but important chance to enhance front-end L-markets. So, don;t try to locate your customers, be their friends or create a social network. Deliver all those small delayered asset tracking disconnects into your online channels and create an efficent long-memory time-phase.

                    Not only your online sales will go up, also the new, digitalized, intimacy will be recreated. Either on facebook, mySpace or the next hype. Remember, you are not a brand, you are a friend!
