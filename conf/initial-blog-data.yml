    title:          A fullfledged, Elo-based ratingsystem for the GX Public pool competition will be here!

                    The Elo rating system is a method for calculating the relative skill levels of players in two-player games such as chess.
                    It is named after its creator Arpad Elo, a Hungarian-born American physics professor.

                    Arpad Elo was a master-level chess player and an active participant in the United States Chess Federation (USCF) from its
                    founding in 1939. The USCF used a numerical ratings system, devised by Kenneth Harkness, to allow members to track their
                    individual progress in terms other than tournament wins and losses. The Harkness system was reasonably fair, but in some
                    circumstances gave rise to ratings which many observers considered inaccurate. On behalf of the USCF, Elo devised a new
                    system with a more statistical basis.
                    
                    Elo's system replaced earlier systems of competitive rewards with a system based on statistical estimation. Rating systems
                    for many sports award points in accordance with subjective evaluations of the 'greatness' of certain achievements. For
                    example, winning an important golf tournament might be worth an arbitrarily chosen five times as many points as winning a
                    lesser tournament.

                    A statistical endeavor, by contrast, uses a model that relates the game results to underlying variables representing the
                    ability of each player.

    title:          The MVC application

                    A Play! application follows the MVC architectural pattern as applied to the 
                    architecture of the Web.
                    
                    This pattern splits the application into separate layers: the Presentation 
                    layer and the Model layer. The Presentation layer is further split into a 
                    View and a Controller layer.
